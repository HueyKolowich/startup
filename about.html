            <p>
                Language learning in a classroom simply isn't that effective. This service enables you to actually develop a second language 
                by providing you with the most powerful resource at your disposal... real time collaborative learning with native speakers! 
                Two language learners will be connected through video conferencing software and a shared activity workspace and there they will 
                be able to give each other real-time feedback as they participate in SLA tasks.
